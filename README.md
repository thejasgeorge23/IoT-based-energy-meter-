**Features**

SCT-013 Current Sensor:

The SCT-013 is a non-invasive split-core type clamp meter sensor designed to measure AC current up to 100 amperes. This type of current sensor is commonly known as a current transformer (CT) and is used for measuring alternating current in a building. The SCT-013 is convenient to use, as it can be easily attached to either the live or neutral wire without any electrical work involving high voltage.
